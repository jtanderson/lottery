Blissful Epidemic Lottery
=======

This is the site which is used to track and operate the weekly Blissful Epidemic lottery.

Details to come later, maybe.

## Deployment

Taken in chunks from https://blog.openshift.com/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meteorjs/

First, `cd blislottery`.
Next, `meteor bundle bundle.tar.gz # to prep for deployment`.
Next, you’ll need to extract the resulting code into your OpenShift application folder 
(minus the “bundle/” folder wrapper that Meteor will automatically include). Use the -k 
flag when extracting to prevent the existing DB connection code from being overwritten 
during this merge process.

On Mac, use `tar -xvf bundle.tar.gz -s '/^bundle//' -C ../meteor/` -- assuming that the
code for the openshift application is in `../meteor/`.

Next, `cd` into the openshift app folder, generated by the `rhc app create` command, or
cloned from the existing application.

Finally, add the new files, commit, and `git push`.
